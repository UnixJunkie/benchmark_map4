 - 5xCV split each dataset for each protein target
   - at the SMILES level
   - encode using each investigated FP ?
     - MAP4
     - ECFP4
     - ECFP6
     - UCAP
     - UHD1
     - UHD2
     - UHD3
     - UHD+inf

 - do a CLI wrapper for each model; expose critical hyper params
   - XGB ?
   - RFR
   - linwrap

 - compute R2 stats (mean+/-stddev) for each model on each target
   - RMSE is also interesting

 - try a model that can cope w/ HD data (LASSO?) for UHD FPs
